abstract = {In this paper we propose and analyze a novel method for automatic stock trading which combines technical analysis and the nearest neighbor classification. Our first and foremost objective is to study the feasibility of the practical use of an intelligent prediction system exclusively based on the history of daily stock closing prices and volumes. To this end we propose a technique that consists of a combination of a nearest neighbor classifier and some well known tools of technical analysis, namely, stop loss, stop gain and RSI filter. For assessing the potential use of the proposed method in practice we compared the results obtained to the results that would be obtained by adopting a buy-and-hold strategy. The key performance measure in this comparison was profitability. The proposed method was shown to generate considerable higher profits than buy-and-hold for most of the companies, with few buy operations generated and, consequently , minimizing the risk of market exposure.},

abstract = {We study the impact that algorithmic trading, computers directly interfacing at high frequency with trading platforms, has had on price discovery and volatility in the foreign exchange market. Our dataset represents a majority of global interdealer trading in three major currency pairs in 2006 and 2007. Importantly , it contains precise observations of the size and the direction of the computer-generated and human-generated trades each minute. The empirical analysis provides several important insights. First, we {\ldots}nd evidence that algorithmic trades tend to be correlated, suggesting that the algorithmic strategies used in the market are not as diverse as those used by non-algorithmic traders. Second, we {\ldots}nd that, despite the apparent correlation of algorithmic trades, there is no evident causal relationship between algorithmic trading and increased exchange rate volatility. If anything, the presence of more algorithmic trading is associated with lower volatility. Third, we show that even though some algorithmic traders appear to restrict their activity in the minute following macroeconomic data releases, algorithmic traders increase their provision of liquidity over the hour following each release. Fourth, we {\ldots}nd that non-algorithmic order ‡ow accounts for a larger share of the variance in exchange rate returns than does algorithmic order ‡ow. Fifth, we {\ldots}nd evidence that supports the recent literature that proposes to depart from the prevalent assumption that liquidity providers in limit order books are passive.

abstract = {This paper introduces a new probabilistic graphical model called gated Bayesian network (GBN). This model evolved from the need to represent processes that include several distinct phases. In essence, a GBN is a model that combines several Bayesian networks (BNs) in such a manner that they may be active or inactive during queries to the model. We use objects called gates to combine BNs, and to activate and deactivate them when predefined logical statements are satisfied. In this paper we also present an algorithm for semi-automatic learning of GBNs. We use the algorithm to learn GBNs that output buy and sell decisions for use in algorithmic trading systems. We show how the learnt GBNs can substantially lower risk towards invested capital, while they at the same time generate similar or better rewards, compared to the benchmark investment strategy buy-and-hold. We also explore some differences and similarities between GBNs and other related formalisms.},

To tell this story, first we must clarify a number of closely related computational trading terms that are often used interchangeably: ˲ algorithmic trading (at) refers to any form of trading using sophisticated algorithms (programmed systems) to automate all or some part of the trade cycle.
