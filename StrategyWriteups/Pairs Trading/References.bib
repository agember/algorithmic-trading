abstract = {We apply machine learning methods to obtain an index arbitrage strategy. In particular, we employ linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) onto the prices of an exchange-traded fund and a stream of stocks. By using principal component analysis (PCA) in reducing the dimension of feature space, we observe the benefit and note the issues in application of SVR. To generate trading signals, we model the residuals from the previous regression as a mean reverting process. At the end, we show how our trading strategies beat the market.},

@article{Gatev2006,
abstract = { We test a Wall Street investment strategy, "pairs trading," with daily data over
 1962-2002. Stocks are matched into pairs with minimum distance between normal?
 ized historical prices. A simple trading rule yields average annualized excess returns of
 up to 11{\%} for self-financing portfolios of pairs. The profits typically exceed conser-
 vative transaction-cost estimates. Bootstrap results suggest that the "pairs" effect
 differs from previously documented reversal profits. Robustness of the excess returns
 indicates that pairs trading profits from temporary mispricing of close substitutes. We
 link the profitability to the presence of a common factor in the returns, different from
 conventional risk measures.},
