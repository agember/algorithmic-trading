abstract = {In this paper we propose and analyze a novel method for automatic stock trading which combines technical analysis and the nearest neighbor classification. Our first and foremost objective is to study the feasibility of the practical use of an intelligent prediction system exclusively based on the history of daily stock closing prices and volumes. To this end we propose a technique that consists of a combination of a nearest neighbor classifier and some well known tools of technical analysis, namely, stop loss, stop gain and RSI filter. For assessing the potential use of the proposed method in practice we compared the results obtained to the results that would be obtained by adopting a buy-and-hold strategy. The key performance measure in this comparison was profitability. The proposed method was shown to generate considerable higher profits than buy-and-hold for most of the companies, with few buy operations generated and, consequently , minimizing the risk of market exposure.},

@article{Bendtsen2016,
abstract = {This paper introduces a new probabilistic graphical model called gated Bayesian network (GBN). This model evolved from the need to represent processes that include several distinct phases. In essence, a GBN is a model that combines several Bayesian networks (BNs) in such a manner that they may be active or inactive during queries to the model. We use objects called gates to combine BNs, and to activate and deactivate them when predefined logical statements are satisfied. In this paper we also present an algorithm for semi-automatic learning of GBNs. We use the algorithm to learn GBNs that output buy and sell decisions for use in algorithmic trading systems. We show how the learnt GBNs can substantially lower risk towards invested capital, while they at the same time generate similar or better rewards, compared to the benchmark investment strategy buy-and-hold. We also explore some differences and similarities between GBNs and other related formalisms.},

This has been a fascinating research area at University College London, where for eight years algorithmic trading systems and an Algorithmic Trading/Risk platform 7 have been developed with leading investment banks/funds. To tell this story, first we must clarify a number of closely related computational trading terms that are often used interchangeably: ˲ algorithmic trading (at) refers to any form of trading using sophisticated algorithms (programmed systems) to automate all or some part of the trade cycle. AT usually involves learning, dynamic planning, reasoning, and decision taking. ˲ systematic trading refers to any trading strategy that is a "rule-based" systematic/repetitive approach to execution trading behaviors. This is often achieved algorithmic Trading Review stock market data, as visualized by artist marius Watz, using a program he created to represent the fast-paced "flows" of data as virtual landscapes. key insights algorithmic Trading (aT) refers to any form of trading using sophisticated algorithms (programmed systems) to automate all or some part of the trade cycle. aT is data-driven and usually involves learning, dynamic planning, reasoning, and decision taking. The key stages in aT are the pre-trade anaylsis, signal generation, trade execution, post-trade analysis, risk management, and asset allocation. Developers use various types of simulations, including backtests and optimizations, to evaluate and improve utility of their algorithms.},

abstract = {We study intraday market intermediation in an electronic market before and during a period of large and temporary selling pressure. On May 6, 2010, U.S. financial markets experienced a systemic intraday event - the Flash Crash - where a large automated selling program was rapidly executed in the E-mini S{\&}P 500 stock index futures market. Using audit trail transaction-level data for the E-mini on May 6 and the previous three days, we find that the trading pattern of the most active nondesignated intraday intermediaries (classified as High Frequency Traders) did not change when prices fell during the Flash Crash.},
