\chapter*{Abstract}

Algorithmic Trading (AT) is a financial sector that trades financial instruments, such as stocks, with algorithms and no human interaction. This allows the largest prop-trading firms in the world to conduct thousands of trades per second. In practice, the vast majority of strategies are implemented using mathematical formulas based on a variety of stock metrics, such as closing price or volume. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms aren't publicly available due to the necessity of secrecy of implementation details. Part of the thesis aims to uncover and examine the effectiveness of existing metrics-based strategies. We find both Pairs Trading and a combined RSI and MACD momentum algorithm to be incredibly effective.

Moving beyond traditional AT strategies, this thesis further aims to investigate using news- or media-content-based strategies. By using Twitter data and Natural Language Processing (NLP), we create a unique trading strategy based on Twitter sentiment of publicly traded companies tweets using a bevy of Machine Learning Models and a Deep Learning model. In this thesis, we find that Machine Learning Models using Twitter sentiment are very ineffective, whereas Deep Learning proves to be very effective at predicting stock movement. This strategy \added[id=AT, remark = {ToDo}] {GIVES US LOTS OF AMAZING RESULTS!}
